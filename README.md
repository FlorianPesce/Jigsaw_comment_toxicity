We solve the "Jigsaw Rate Severity of Toxic Comments" Kaggle challenge in this project

Our experiments can be found in the following notebooks:

Classification experiments:
1. ULMFiT model on the Jiagsaw1 dataset: notebooks/ulmfit_on_jigsaw1.ipynb
2. ULMFiT model on the Ruddit dataset: notebooks/ulmfit_on_ruddit.ipynb

Regression experiments: notebooks/Regression.ipynb

Data prepapation notebook for classification experiments on Jigsaw1 data:
notebooks/data_prep.ipynb

The notebooks are self-explanatory and the best way to run the notebooks to reproduce the results would be Google Colab. All the required dependences are installed in Colab.
